Before learning about Docker, we need to know why Docker is needed. Imagine there is XYZ company that is developing a website for client Ram. Developers of XYZ made a fully functional website on his Mac and sent the source code to Ram. But when Ram tries to open the website on his local machine (Windows), it doesn't work. When Ram complains about the issue to XYZ company, the developer says, "It's working on my machine." This is all because of different OS, different versions of packages, and code environment.
