Before learning about Docker, we need to know why Docker is needed. Imagine there is  company that is developing a website for client Ram. Developers made a fully functional website on his Mac and sent the source code to Ram. But when Ram tries to open the website on his local machine (Windows), it doesn't work. When Ram complains about the issue to company, the developer says, "It's working on my machine." This is all because of different OS, different versions of packages, and code environment.

## Concept of Containerization
During development, we use different libraries, tools, and dependencies. Whenever we try to use the same source code on a different machine, we need to manually install those tools and dependencies. Sometimes, even after installing them, the software doesnâ€™t run due to OS-level dependencies.

To address this problem, the concept of virtualization was introduced. However, virtualization often consumes a large amount of system resources. To overcome this limitation, Docker and the concept of containerization were later introduced as a more lightweight and efficient solution.
